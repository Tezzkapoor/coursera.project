        <h1>Microprocessor - 8085 Architecture</h1>
<p class=
 >8085 is pronounced as "eighty-eighty-five" microprocessor. It is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Intel in 1977 using NMOS technology. <br>

    It has the following configuration</p>
<ol>
<li id=""> 8-bit data bus </li>
<li > 16-bit address bus, which can address upto 64KB </li>
<li> A 16-bit program counter </li>
<li> A 16-bit stack pointer </li>
<li> Six 8-bit registers arranged in pairs: BC, DE, HL </li>
</ol>

<p class="accu">It is an 8-bit register used to perform arithmetic, logical, I/O & LOAD/STORE operations.  It is connected to internal data bus & ALU. <br>
    As the name suggests, it performs arithmetic and logical operations like Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, etc. on 8-bit data <br>
    There are 6 general purpose registers in 8085 processor, i.e. B, C, D, E, H & L. Each register can hold 8-bit data. <br>

    These registers can work in pair to hold 16-bit data and their pairing combination is like B-C, D-E & H-L.

<p id="8085 2">
    The "5" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-volt (V) power supply by using depletion-mode transistors,
     rather than requiring the +5 V, −5 V and +12 V supplies needed by the 8080.
     <br> This capability matched that of the competing Z80, a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. <br> 
     These processors could be used in computers running the CP/M operating system.

    The most important part of the microprocessor is the central processing unit. <span id="author">Tezz kapoor</span> </p>

<p class="all">Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. 
   <br> This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909). <br>
   He subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields, and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation.
